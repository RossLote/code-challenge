# Sponge frontend engineer coding task

Welcome to our coding challenge for a frontend engineering position.

Please take as long as you wish to complete this task. It should take you no longer than 3-4 hours to complete but feel free to take longer if you want to add some flare.

Please make lots of commits as you go so that we can see how the project evolves.

### Getting started
Fork this project on github and push all code to the forked repository

### Tech stack
Use which ever frameworks and libraries you like. This is a purely frontend project so don't worry about building a backend for it.

## The challenge
Build a image slide show editor and player. 

Use the following design as a base for the project.
![slideshow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1877650/112300374-aec11200-8c90-11eb-9234-00678fe30e4e.png)

The page is divided into two sections from left to right:
- Preview list
- Slide editor

Feel free to make any improvments you see fit but keep the core layout the same.

### Requirements:
- When the page loads the user must start with one blank slide
- Clicking "Add slide" must add one blank slide to the end of the slideshow
- To add an image to a slide the user must drag and drop a file onto the slide editor
- To edit a specific slide the user must click the slide in the preview list
- The user must be able to draw on the slides, i.e., use the mouse to draw lines or write words (see design image)
- When the user presses "Play" the slideshow should be displayed full window and cycle through the slides with a 3 second delay between transitions
- Pressing the "Esc" key should take the user back to the editor

## Bonus
If you finish all of the above and you fancy adding a few finishing touches you could do the following:
- Add local storage so that a user can reload the page without loosing work
- Use left and right keys to cycle through images
- Ability to re-order the slides
- Ability to delete slides
- Nice transition effect between slides
- Any extra feature you can think of...have fun!
